# Deploying as a Remote MCP Server

## Anaplan modeling principles alignment

This document should be read alongside Anaplan's current modeling guidance:
- Your modeling experience: https://help.anaplan.com/your-modeling-experience-ee72bb4a-463f-44f7-bfb1-09892a951472
- Model building recommendations: https://help.anaplan.com/model-building-recommendations-6d742812-f1c7-4296-a504-651b1c8086f3
- Planual: https://support.anaplan.com/planual-5731dc37-317a-49fa-a5ff-7fc3926972de

Apply these principles when using the MCP tools against live models:

1. Start with the business case, not the API endpoint. Identify the planning process, decision points, facts, lists, time ranges, versions, and users before changing structures or data.
2. Follow DISCO module separation: Data, Input, System, Calculation, and Output modules should have clear responsibilities. Do not mix imports, assumptions, business logic, and reporting line items in one module unless the model owner has intentionally designed it that way.
3. Respect the Central Library. Lists, subsets, line item subsets, time, versions, users, roles, and naming conventions are shared model architecture, not disposable integration artefacts.
4. Prefer narrow dimensionality. Use only the dimensions required for a calculation or input. Use subsets, line-item applies-to, and time ranges to reduce cell count and improve performance.
5. Keep formulas simple, reusable, and auditable. Break complex logic into intermediate line items, use system modules for mappings and attributes, and avoid hard-coded item references where a lookup or mapping module is more maintainable.
6. Preserve model-builder intent. Before writing cells, adding list items, running imports, or changing calendar/version settings, inspect modules, line items, dimensions, saved views, actions, and task history so the operation follows the existing model design.
7. Use saved views and purpose-built import/export actions for integrations. Do not treat ad hoc grid reads/writes as a substitute for governed integration processes when a model already exposes actions or processes.
8. Validate before and after every write. Check source file mapping, dimensional coordinates, access permissions, model state, task result, rejected rows, and downstream output modules.
9. Protect ALM and production controls. Treat structural changes, list changes, current period, fiscal year, switchover, delete actions, and model open/close as governed operations that may affect production users.
10. Document assumptions. Record the model, workspace, module/view/action used, dimensional filters, version/time context, and any Planual trade-offs made during automation.

This guide covers deploying anaplan-mcp as a remote HTTP server for Claude Web (claude.ai), ChatGPT, and other browser-based AI assistants that support remote MCP connectors.

## How it works

The server has two transport modes:

- **stdio** (`npm start`) -- for local clients like Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- **Streamable HTTP** (`npm run start:http`) -- for remote clients over HTTPS

The HTTP mode serves MCP over a standard HTTP endpoint. Clients connect via POST/GET/DELETE on `/mcp`.

## Quick start (Fly.io)

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/larasrinath/anaplan-mcp.git
cd anaplan-mcp
```

### 2. Deploy to Fly.io

Sign up at [fly.io](https://fly.io) (GitHub login works). Connect your repo and deploy. The included `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml` handle everything.

Set your Anaplan OAuth client in the Fly.io dashboard so each remote session can authorize with its own Anaplan identity:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` | your-anaplan-oauth-client-id |

Optional: add `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` if you also want an outer bearer-token gate in front of the MCP endpoint.

If you expect very large inline MCP payloads, you can also set `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT`. The server defaults to `100mb`, which is enough for most `run_import` and `upload_file` requests.

### 3. Connect from Claude Web

1. Point your remote MCP client at `https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp`
2. Use the Anaplan OAuth flow exposed by the tools when the first authenticated call is made
3. If you enabled `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`, configure your client or reverse proxy to send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. Start a new chat and try: "list my workspaces"

## Requirements for cloud deployment

These are **all required** for the server to work with remote MCP clients. Missing any one of them will cause "Couldn't reach the MCP server" errors.

### 1. Use per-session Anaplan OAuth

Remote HTTP mode now assumes each MCP session authenticates to Anaplan separately. Set `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` on the server; the HTTP transport creates a fresh OAuth-backed `AuthManager` for each session instead of sharing a process-wide Anaplan user.

If `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` is missing, HTTP mode fails fast at startup.

### 2. Bind to 0.0.0.0

Express defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). Cloud platforms route traffic through reverse proxies that cannot reach localhost. The server must bind to all interfaces:

```typescript
app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => { ... });
```

Without this, the platform logs will show: `instance refused connection. is your app listening on 0.0.0.0:8080?`

### 3. GET must return 200 for reachability checks

MCP clients send a `GET` request to the endpoint before attempting to initialize. Without a valid session, this must return **200** (not 400 or 404). The client uses this as a health/reachability probe.

```typescript
app.get("/mcp", async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.headers["mcp-session-id"];
  if (!sessionId || !transports[sessionId]) {
    res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
    return;
  }
  await transports[sessionId].handleRequest(req, res);
});
```

### 4. Enable JSON response mode

The `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` defaults to `text/event-stream` (SSE) responses. Remote MCP clients may not handle SSE. Enable JSON responses:

```typescript
new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
  sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID(),
  enableJsonResponse: true,  // Returns application/json instead of SSE
});
```

### 5. Set CORS and anti-buffering headers

Cloud reverse proxies (Fly.io, Render, Cloudflare) buffer responses by default, which breaks streaming. Set these headers:

```typescript
res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS");
res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
  "Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, mcp-session-id, mcp-protocol-version, Last-Event-ID, X-MCP-API-Key, X-API-Key");
res.setHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers", "mcp-session-id, mcp-protocol-version");
res.setHeader("X-Accel-Buffering", "no");
res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate");
```

### 6. Raise the JSON body limit for bulk requests

Express defaults JSON parsing to `100kb`, which is too small for remote MCP calls that inline CSV/text payloads. The server now configures `express.json({ limit: "100mb" })` by default.

If your deployment needs a different ceiling, set `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT` (or `MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT`) to any value accepted by Express/body-parser, such as `25mb` or `250mb`.

### 7. Handle both / and /mcp paths

Some clients connect to the root URL, others append `/mcp`. Register handlers on both paths to be safe.

### 8. Defer Anaplan auth to tool call time

Session initialization should still succeed before the user authorizes with Anaplan. The first tool call can surface the device-grant URL/code cleanly, and the retry completes with that session's own OAuth token:

```typescript
// Create a fresh AuthManager for each HTTP session
const mcpServer = createServer(AuthManager.fromRemoteHttpEnv());
```

## Platform notes

### Fly.io (recommended)

- Free tier: 3 shared VMs, 256MB RAM each
- Auto-stops after inactivity, auto-starts on request (~1-2s cold start)
- No Cloudflare in front -- direct connection
- Requires credit card for signup

### Render

- Free tier: 750 hours/month, no credit card required
- Cloudflare proxy in front -- may interfere with MCP connections
- 50+ second cold starts on free tier
- **Not recommended** for MCP servers due to proxy buffering issues

### Google Cloud Run

- Free tier: 2M requests/month
- Requires billing account (won't charge within free limits)
- Auto-scales to zero, fast cold starts

## Local testing

```bash
npm run dev:http  # Starts on http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Test the handshake:

```bash
export ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1"}},"id":1}'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| HTTP process exits on startup | Missing `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` | Configure the Anaplan OAuth client for remote mode |
| "Couldn't reach the MCP server" | GET returns non-200 | Make GET /mcp return 200 without a session |
| "Couldn't reach" + no request logs | App bound to 127.0.0.1 | Bind to 0.0.0.0 |
| Session initializes but client fails | SSE response format | Set `enableJsonResponse: true` |
| Tool call asks user to authorize repeatedly | Session-scoped OAuth not yet completed | Open the Anaplan auth URL shown in the tool error, approve, then retry the same tool call |
| Intermittent failures | Platform cold starts | Use a health check ping or paid tier |
| Connection refused in platform logs | Wrong internal port | Match Dockerfile EXPOSE with fly.toml internal_port |
