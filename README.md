# Anaplan MCP

## Anaplan modeling principles alignment

This document should be read alongside Anaplan's current modeling guidance:
- Your modeling experience: https://help.anaplan.com/your-modeling-experience-ee72bb4a-463f-44f7-bfb1-09892a951472
- Model building recommendations: https://help.anaplan.com/model-building-recommendations-6d742812-f1c7-4296-a504-651b1c8086f3
- Planual: https://support.anaplan.com/planual-5731dc37-317a-49fa-a5ff-7fc3926972de

Apply these principles when using the MCP tools against live models:

1. Start with the business case, not the API endpoint. Identify the planning process, decision points, facts, lists, time ranges, versions, and users before changing structures or data.
2. Follow DISCO module separation: Data, Input, System, Calculation, and Output modules should have clear responsibilities. Do not mix imports, assumptions, business logic, and reporting line items in one module unless the model owner has intentionally designed it that way.
3. Respect the Central Library. Lists, subsets, line item subsets, time, versions, users, roles, and naming conventions are shared model architecture, not disposable integration artefacts.
4. Prefer narrow dimensionality. Use only the dimensions required for a calculation or input. Use subsets, line-item applies-to, and time ranges to reduce cell count and improve performance.
5. Keep formulas simple, reusable, and auditable. Break complex logic into intermediate line items, use system modules for mappings and attributes, and avoid hard-coded item references where a lookup or mapping module is more maintainable.
6. Preserve model-builder intent. Before writing cells, adding list items, running imports, or changing calendar/version settings, inspect modules, line items, dimensions, saved views, actions, and task history so the operation follows the existing model design.
7. Use saved views and purpose-built import/export actions for integrations. Do not treat ad hoc grid reads/writes as a substitute for governed integration processes when a model already exposes actions or processes.
8. Validate before and after every write. Check source file mapping, dimensional coordinates, access permissions, model state, task result, rejected rows, and downstream output modules.
9. Protect ALM and production controls. Treat structural changes, list changes, current period, fiscal year, switchover, delete actions, and model open/close as governed operations that may affect production users.
10. Document assumptions. Record the model, workspace, module/view/action used, dimensional filters, version/time context, and any Planual trade-offs made during automation.

### Unofficial MCP server for Anaplan

> **[Setup guide](https://www.larasrinath.com/project/2026-02-09-anaplan-mcp/#setup-guide)**: platform-aware install walkthrough for Windows, macOS, and Linux with OAuth2 / Certificate / Basic Auth options.

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to Anaplan's Integration API v2. Gives LLMs like Claude direct access to browse workspaces, manage data, run imports/exports, and administer models through 70 structured tools, using your existing Anaplan credentials and permissions.

Built in TypeScript. Supports both stdio (local) and Streamable HTTP (remote) transports. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, claude.ai, and any MCP-compatible client. Includes a built-in orchestration guide that teaches the AI assistant the correct tool sequences for every workflow.

**Note: This server was developed using Hermes Agent. Claude Code has not been tested as a development environment for this project.**

## Why This Exists

**Anaplan's Integration API is powerful but requires technical expertise to use directly.** Most teams rely on a handful of model builders to navigate complex models, extract data, and run imports - creating bottlenecks when others need access to the same information.

This server wraps the API in 76 structured tools (including 3 with Playwright UI automation fallback) that AI assistants like Claude can call on your behalf. Explore models, pull data, run actions, and onboard new team members - all by asking in plain English instead of writing API calls or waiting for someone who knows the model.

**For business users:** Stop waiting for someone to pull data or explain how a model works. Ask Claude to show you the numbers, walk you through module structure, or run your regular imports.

**For model builders and consultants:** Analyze model structure, trace formula dependencies, review line item configurations, and identify performance issues - all through conversation instead of clicking through hundreds of modules manually.

**For IT and platform teams:** Standard API access using your existing authentication and permissions. No new credentials, no elevated access. Open source for auditability. Anaplan data is processed by your AI assistant - locally or through your provider's environment depending on your setup.

## Common Use Cases

**Model Documentation:**
- "Show me the structure of the Supply Planning model"
- "List all line items and their formulas in the Revenue module"
- "What dimensions does the Margin line item use?"

**Data Review:**
- "Pull the current pricing data for all products"
- "Show me which list items were recently added"
- "Read the forecast numbers for Q3 and summarize"

**Impact Analysis:**
- "What modules use the Product list as a dimension?"
- "Show all line items that reference Cost Per Unit"
- "Which views include the Region dimension?"

**Automation:**
- "Run the monthly demand import and show me the result"
- "Export sales actuals and save to Downloads"
- "Add these 50 new products to the master list"

**Onboarding:**
- "Walk me through the modules in this model"
- "How is this model structured? What are the key lists?"
- "What changed in this model since last quarter?"



## Development

This server was developed using the **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/anthropics/hermes)** - an AI agent framework from Anthropic that powers tools like Claude Code. The development workflow involved orchestrating multiple AI agents to implement, test, and document the Anaplan MCP integration.

**Note:** While development was done using Hermes Agent, this repository is intended for general use with any MCP-compatible client. The Hermes Agent toolset enables automated multi-step workflows that accelerate development, but the resulting MCP server itself is platform-agnostic and works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, claude.ai, and other MCP clients.

## What It Can and Can't Do

### What it can do
- Browse workspaces, models, modules, lists, and views
- Read cell data and list items
- Write cell values and manage list items (add, update, delete)
- Run imports, exports, processes, and delete actions
- Upload and download files
- Manage models (open, close, delete, set periods and fiscal year)
- Change model mode, create lists, and create modules via Playwright UI automation (when API returns 405)
- Query users, versions, and task history

### Model Building Limitations
The Anaplan API does not support:
- Defining formulas through API
- Building model structure from scratch
- Configuring model calendar programmatically

For structural creation (lists, modules, line items) blocked by the API on some tenants, enable Playwright UI automation (`ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true`). See the **Playwright UI Automation** section below and [`docs/guides/anaplan-playwright-structural-crud.md`](docs/guides/anaplan-playwright-structural-crud.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - [download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **An Anaplan account** with API access (any auth method - basic, certificate, or OAuth)
- **An MCP-compatible client** - Claude Desktop (recommended), Claude Code, or any other MCP client

## Setup

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinstep/hermes-anaplan-mcp.git
cd hermes-anaplan-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Connect to Claude Desktop

Two ways to connect: build a **Claude Desktop extension** (`.mcpb` file, single-click install, settings editable in Claude's UI) or edit the **JSON config** by hand. The extension is recommended unless you need remote HTTP mode or want to run from source without packaging.

#### Option A: Build and install the extension (recommended)

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

This compiles the server, stages a production-only copy (no dev dependencies, no docs/tests), and packs it into `anaplan-mcp.mcpb` in the repo root. Requires the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above; `npx` will fetch the `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` packaging tool on first run.

Then in Claude Desktop: **Settings → Extensions → Install from file...** and pick `anaplan-mcp.mcpb`. Claude renders a settings form for every field defined in [`manifest.json`](manifest.json)'s `user_config` (instance, OAuth client ID, username/password, certificate paths, and the Playwright toggles) — fill in whichever auth method you're using and leave the rest blank. Nothing needs manual JSON editing, and secrets like the password field are masked.

If you later enable the Playwright fallback, install its browser binary inside the installed extension folder (Claude shows the path under the extension's details):

```bash
cd <extension folder>
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium
```

Re-run `npm run build:extension` and reinstall whenever you pull new code — the bundle isn't auto-updated from source.

#### Option B: JSON config

**Step 1: Open the config file**

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If the file doesn't exist yet, create it with `{}` as the contents.

> **Tip (Windows):** You can type `%APPDATA%\Claude` in the File Explorer address bar to jump straight to the folder.

**Step 2: Add the Anaplan server**

Replace `<path>` with the absolute path to your cloned repo (e.g. `/Users/you/anaplan-mcp` on macOS/Linux or `C:/Users/you/anaplan-mcp` on Windows - always use forward slashes).

Choose **one** auth method only. For most users, use **OAuth2** so Claude can show a sign-in link in chat. Do not set OAuth, certificate, and basic env vars together.

Also choose which **Anaplan instance** (tenant region) to connect to via `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE`. This affects every auth method. Supported values today: `us1` (default) and `au1`. See [Anaplan instances](#anaplan-instances) below for details and for connecting to instances not built in.

**Recommended: OAuth2 (device grant)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anaplan": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "ANAPLAN_INSTANCE": "us1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On first use, Claude shows a link in chat, approve it in Anaplan, then retry your request. OAuth tokens are kept in memory only. If the MCP process restarts, or an OAuth session is idle for more than 60 minutes, you'll be prompted to authorize again unless you provide `ANAPLAN_REFRESH_TOKEN` yourself.

OAuth support is device grant only. `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ANAPLAN_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_CODE`, and `ANAPLAN_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` are ignored by the server.

If you do not want OAuth, use one of these alternatives instead:

**Certificate auth**
```json
"env": {
  "ANAPLAN_CERTIFICATE_PATH": "/path/to/cert.pem",
  "ANAPLAN_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/path/to/key.pem"
}
```
`ANAPLAN_CERTIFICATE_ENCODED_DATA_FORMAT` can be added optionally; defaults to `v2`. Set `v1` only for legacy tenants.

**Basic auth**

```json
"env": {
  "ANAPLAN_USERNAME": "user@company.com",
  "ANAPLAN_PASSWORD": "your-password"
}
```

Use this only if you want email/password auth instead of OAuth or certificate auth. If your Anaplan account uses SSO, basic auth may not work unless your tenant allows exception users.

If your config file already has content, add `mcpServers` inside the existing top-level object - don't create a second `{}` block.

**Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop**

Quit Claude Desktop completely (right-click the system tray icon and quit - don't just close the window) and reopen it. You should see the Anaplan tools available (look for the hammer icon in the chat input area).

**Troubleshooting:**

- **"Unexpected non-whitespace" error** - Your JSON is invalid. Make sure there's only one `{}` object in the file and no trailing commas. Paste your config into [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com/) to check.
- **Server disconnected** - Run `node C:/path/to/hermes-anaplan-mcp/dist/index.js` in a terminal to see the actual error. Common causes: wrong path in `args`, missing `npm run build`, or Node.js not installed.
- **401 Unauthorized when using tools** - Your Anaplan credentials are wrong, or your account uses SSO (in which case basic auth won't work - use certificate or OAuth2 instead).
- **OAuth refresh failed / reauthorization required** - The MCP server is up and reached Anaplan, but the saved OAuth session is no longer valid. Re-authorize in your MCP client, then retry the tool.

### Connect to Claude Code

**Note:** Claude Code was not used as a development environment for this project. If you encounter issues, try using Claude Desktop first for comparison.

Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json` and fill in your credentials. The file is gitignored by default - never commit credentials to version control.

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
```

Alternatively, use the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add anaplan -- node /absolute/path/to/hermes-anaplan-mcp/dist/index.js
```

### Other MCP clients

Any MCP-compatible client that supports stdio transport can connect. The server expects to be launched as a subprocess with stdin/stdout for communication. Pass Anaplan credentials via environment variables.

### Browser-based AI (claude.ai, ChatGPT)

The server also supports **Streamable HTTP transport** for remote MCP connections from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), and other browser-based AI assistants. Deploy to a cloud platform (Fly.io recommended) and connect via the remote MCP integration settings.

Remote HTTP mode is designed for **per-session Anaplan OAuth**, not a single shared Anaplan user. Set `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` on the server so each remote session can authorize against Anaplan with its own identity. Set `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE` on the server too (see [Anaplan instances](#anaplan-instances)) - it applies to every session, since the instance is fixed per deployment. Basic auth (`ANAPLAN_USERNAME`/`ANAPLAN_PASSWORD`) and certificate auth (`ANAPLAN_CERTIFICATE_PATH`/`ANAPLAN_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`) are intentionally **not** supported in remote HTTP mode — they would collapse every session onto one shared Anaplan identity, breaking per-user permissions and auditability. They remain available for stdio/local use only. If you want an extra outer gate in front of the endpoint, you can also set `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` and have your client or reverse proxy send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

See the **[Remote Deployment Guide](docs/guides/deploying-remote.md)** for full setup instructions, platform recommendations, and troubleshooting.

## Configuration

### Anaplan instances

Anaplan tenants live on different instances (regions), each with its own auth and API hosts. Set `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE` to choose one - it applies to OAuth, certificate, and basic auth alike, plus every transactional/bulk API call.

| `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE` | Auth base URL | API base URL |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| `us1` (default) | `https://auth.anaplan.com` | `https://api.anaplan.com` |
| `au1` | `https://au1a.app2.anaplan.com` | `https://api.au1a.app2.anaplan.com` |

If you don't set `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE`, the server defaults to `us1`. Most tenants are reachable through the global `us1` hosts regardless of where they're physically provisioned - if you're not sure which to pick, try `us1` first and switch to `au1` if you get 403s on every call.

For an instance that isn't built in, set `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE` to any identifier plus both override URLs:

```json
"env": {
  "ANAPLAN_INSTANCE": "eu1",
  "ANAPLAN_INSTANCE_AUTH_BASE_URL": "https://eu1a.app2.anaplan.com",
  "ANAPLAN_INSTANCE_API_BASE_URL": "https://api.eu1a.app2.anaplan.com"
}
```

Note: this selects the instance used for OAuth/certificate/basic auth and the transactional/bulk API. It's independent of `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_REGION`, which controls the region used by the separate Playwright UI-automation fallback (see [Playwright UI Automation](#playwright-ui-automation-3-tools)).

### Environment variables

All configuration is done through environment variables. There are no config files, CLI flags, or settings menus.

| Method | Env Vars | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| OAuth2 (device grant) | `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` | Highest priority. Device authorization flow. Claude shows you the URL and code in chat; authorize in browser then retry. Tokens stay in memory only, so restart or >60 minutes of idle time requires another device login unless you set `ANAPLAN_REFRESH_TOKEN` manually |
| Certificate | `ANAPLAN_CERTIFICATE_PATH`, `ANAPLAN_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `ANAPLAN_CERTIFICATE_ENCODED_DATA_FORMAT` (optional) | Second priority. PEM certificate + private key, authenticates via CACertificate flow. Data format defaults to `v2` |
| Basic | `ANAPLAN_USERNAME`, `ANAPLAN_PASSWORD` | Lowest priority. Email + password, sends base64 credentials to auth endpoint |
| Instance selection | `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE` (optional, defaults to `us1`), `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE_AUTH_BASE_URL` / `ANAPLAN_INSTANCE_API_BASE_URL` (optional, for instances not built in) | Applies to all auth methods above. See [Anaplan instances](#anaplan-instances) |

You only need one set of credentials. If multiple are configured, the server picks the highest-priority method automatically.

### HTTP transport security

These apply only to `npm run start:http` / remote MCP deployments:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID` | Required for remote HTTP mode. Each HTTP session uses this OAuth client to authenticate the end user with Anaplan |
| `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional extra edge protection. When set, callers must also send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` is accepted as an alias |
| `ANAPLAN_MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT` | Optional JSON body limit for remote HTTP requests. Defaults to `100mb` to support large `run_import` and `upload_file` payloads. `MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT` is accepted as an alias |

### Where to set environment variables

- **Claude Code config:** Use the `"env"` block in `.mcp.json` (file is gitignored by default)
- **Claude Desktop config:** Use the `"env"` block in the JSON config (keeps credentials scoped to the server)
- **Shell profile:** Export in `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` for Claude Code CLI usage
- **System environment:** Set at the OS level if you prefer

> **Security note:** Never commit credentials to version control. Env files and MCP config files are gitignored by default in this repo.

## Permissions and Safety

### What the server can do

This server has **full access** to whatever your Anaplan credentials allow. The 76 tools cover read, write, action, admin, and UI automation operations:

- **Read-only tools** (safe to use freely): `show_*` tools, `read_cells`, `get_list_items`, `download_file`, `get_action_status`
- **Write tools** (modify data): `write_cells`, `add_list_items`, `update_list_items`, `delete_list_items`, `create_list`, `create_module`, `add_lineitem`, `delete_list`, `delete_module`
- **Action tools** (trigger Anaplan processes): `run_import`, `run_export`, `run_process`, `run_delete`
- **Admin tools** (model management): `close_model`, `open_model`, `bulk_delete_models`, `set_currentperiod`, `set_fiscalyear`
- **UI automation tools** (Playwright browser fallback): `set_modelmode`, `create_list` (UI path), `create_module` (UI path)

### Tool approval in Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop prompts you before each tool call. You'll see the tool name and parameters, and can approve or deny. This gives you a chance to review before any action runs. You can also use the "Allow for this chat" option for tools you trust.

### Recommendations

- **Start with read-only.** Ask Claude to explore your workspaces and models before running any write operations. Get comfortable with the tool output first.
- **Test in a dev workspace.** If you have a non-production Anaplan workspace, use that while getting familiar with the tools.
- **Use least-privilege credentials.** If your Anaplan admin can create a service account with limited workspace access, use that instead of your personal admin account.
- **Review before confirming write operations.** When Claude proposes to run an import, write cells, or delete items, read the parameters carefully before approving.
- **Exports and imports are asynchronous.** The server polls until they complete (up to 5 minutes). You can cancel a running task with `cancel_task` if needed.

### Playwright UI Automation (3 tools)

Some Anaplan operations are blocked by the Transactional API v2.0 on certain tenants (returns HTTP 405). When Playwright UI automation is enabled, these tools automatically fall back to browser-based interaction with the Anaplan web interface.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `set_modelmode` | Change model mode via Anaplan UI (UNLOCKED, LOCKED, ARCHIVED, PRODUCTION, PRODUCTION_MAINTENANCE). Falls back to Playwright browser automation when the API returns 405<br>UI flow: Home → Model Management → select model → Change Mode → pick mode → OK |
| `create_list` | Create a new list via Anaplan UI. Falls back to Playwright when the API returns 405<br>UI flow: Open model → Settings → Lists → Add List → fill name → Save |
| `create_module` | Create a new module via Anaplan UI. Falls back to Playwright when the API returns 405<br>UI flow: Open model → Settings → Modules → Add Module → fill name → Save |

Playwright is an **optional dependency** of this package (not installed by a plain `npm install`), so the server boots fine without it — it's only required if you actually turn this feature on.

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium && npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED` | Yes | Set to `true` to enable Playwright fallback. Default: `false` |
| `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_REGION` | No | Anaplan region for URL routing. Default: `au1a`. Maps to `https://{region}.app2.anaplan.com` |
| `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS` | No | Set to `false` for interactive MFA entry. Default: `true` |
| `ANAPLAN_USERNAME` | Yes | Anaplan email (shared with API auth) |
| `ANAPLAN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Anaplan password (shared with API auth) |

**Enabling it in Claude Desktop:** add the variables above to the same `env` block used for auth, in your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anaplan": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ANAPLAN_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "ANAPLAN_INSTANCE": "us1",
        "ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED": "true",
        "ANAPLAN_USERNAME": "user@company.com",
        "ANAPLAN_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Leave `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED` unset (or `"false"`) to keep the 3 fallback tools purely advisory — they'll still register, but return a guidance message instead of driving a browser, and Playwright itself never needs to be installed.

**Architecture:**

- **Lazy browser lifecycle** — Chromium launches on first use, authenticates, and stays alive for subsequent calls. After 5 minutes of idle time the browser closes gracefully.
- **API-first with automatic fallback** — tools attempt the REST API first; on HTTP 405 they invoke the Playwright UI automation. When Playwright is disabled, a guidance message tells the user to perform the action manually in the Anaplan UI.
- **MFA support** — if MFA is required and running headless, the tool throws a clear error. Set `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false` for interactive MFA entry.
- **Not installed vs. disabled** — if `ANAPLAN_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true` but the `playwright` package isn't installed, the server still starts; only the fallback call itself fails, with an error telling you to run `npm install playwright`.

**Important notes:**

- The Anaplan SPA renders model content inside an iframe named `"App shell content"`. Playwright automation uses `frameLocator` for model-level operations.
- The models list page may use closed Shadow DOM or custom rendering that is invisible to Playwright DOM access. The automation includes screenshot-based fallbacks for these cases.
- All Playwright errors capture screenshots to `/tmp/anaplan-ui-debug/<action>-<timestamp>.png` for diagnosis.
- Patch `src/*.ts` only — `npm run build` overwrites `dist/` from source.

## Orchestration Guide

The server exposes a built-in MCP resource (`anaplan://orchestration-guide`) that AI assistants read automatically. This guide teaches the correct tool sequences for every workflow category:

- **Navigation** -- workspace -> model -> module -> line items/views
- **Reading data** -- discover modules, find views, read cells (with fallback to large volume reads for >1M cells)
- **Writing data** -- resolve line item dimensions and item IDs before calling write_cells
- **Bulk imports** -- inspect import definition, upload data to source file, run import, check status, download error dump if failed
- **Bulk exports** -- single-step run_export handles the full lifecycle
- **Processes** -- run chained actions, monitor with get_action_status
- **Large volume reads** -- create request, poll until complete, download pages, clean up
- **List & structural mutations** -- create/delete lists and modules, add line items, then add/update/delete list items

Every tool description also includes prerequisite hints ("Use show_imports first to find importId") and parameter descriptions explain where each value comes from ("from show_lineitems or show_alllineitems"). Key workflow tools append "Next steps" guidance to their responses.

Four layers:

1. **Auth layer** - pluggable providers behind a common `AuthProvider` interface. The `AuthManager` selects the right provider from env vars and handles token lifecycle.
2. **API layer** - `AnaplanClient` handles all HTTP communication with the Anaplan API. 17 domain wrappers provide typed methods for each endpoint. Auto-paginates list endpoints using Anaplan's `meta.paging` metadata.
3. **UI layer** - `AnaplanUI` (Playwright) handles operations the Transactional API v2.0 blocks with HTTP 405. Lazy browser lifecycle: launches Chromium on first use, authenticates, stays alive for 5 minutes idle, then shuts down. Tools call the API first and fall back to Playwright on 405.
4. **Tools layer** - registers MCP tools on the server with zod schemas for input validation. Each tool delegates to the appropriate API wrapper (or UI fallback) and formats results. Key tools include next-step hints to guide multi-tool workflows.
